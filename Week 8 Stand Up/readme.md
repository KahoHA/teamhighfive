#### User Testing & Goals:
We have done some users testing with our current mock-ups prototype before the week 8 stand up workshop session. We invited 5 people from different industries to do the user testing and survey after that. This prototype is aimed to let user test the main functionality and interface of our application.

#### Target users/audience:
Our target users are those who intended to start up a business and look for business idea/ business partner/ investor. 


#### Structure of the testing survey:
-	Problem Space: Idea of the user background in order to compare with our target audience. 
-	Design Functionality: Interaction with the core functionality of the interface by searching a skill for an industry.
-	Design Aesthetic: General idea of their reaction towards the design and aesthetic of the interface.
-	Sustainability: How the users react to continuous use of the application and their reaction towards the system.
